# TASK: verse digest, chunk 1319 (10 segments from 1 sources)

## ROLE
You take notes on the sources below, so that a later writer can build commentary prose from your notes without rereading the source. You do not write commentary. Do not spawn agents. Do not change the task.

## SOURCES IN THIS CHUNK
- BAQILLANI: Iʿjāz al-Qurʾān, al-Bāqillānī, d. 403 AH (ulum)

What matters by kind of source:
- **ulum**: A work on the Qurʾānic sciences. Record what it says about the verse: rhetoric, inimitability, abrogation, occasions of revelation, structure, with the authorities cited.

Verses in scope for this run (your segments may also discuss neighbouring verses; record those too):
- 55:4: عَلَّمَهُ ٱلْبَيَانَ
- 68:2: مَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍۢ
- 96:16: نَاصِيَةٍۢ كَٰذِبَةٍ خَاطِئَةٍۢ
- 100:8: وَإِنَّهُۥ لِحُبِّ ٱلْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ
- 68:42: يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَن سَاقٍۢ وَيُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى ٱلسُّجُودِ فَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ
- 72:1: قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ ٱسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌۭ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْءَانًا عَجَبًۭا
- 74:15: ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ
- 89:16: وَأَمَّآ إِذَا مَا ٱبْتَلَىٰهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقَهُۥ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّىٓ أَهَٰنَنِ
- 92:11: وَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُۥٓ إِذَا تَرَدَّىٰٓ

## THE ONLY COMMANDS YOU MAY RUN
Run each command alone, exactly as written: no `cd`, no `&&`, no `;`. **Run every command with 12,000 output tokens** (set the shell tool's maximum output to 12,000 tokens).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cat enrichment/v7/work/t1_s096_20261009/chunks/c1319.pK.txt` (K = 0 … 1) | prints part K of your chunk (at most 10,000 characters) |
| `python3 -B enrichment/v7/digest.py check t1_s096_20261009 --model luna-max --chunk 1319` | checks your output file and lists every problem |

No other commands, files, web or repository search.

## PROCEDURE: follow in order, each step once
**Step 1.** Read parts 0 to 1 in order, each exactly once. Each segment starts with `=== SEGMENT <LOCATOR> | source <ID> | verses … | heading ===`; a segment may continue into the next part. If a part looks cut (no `<<part K ends …>>` or `<<end of chunk>>` line at its end), run that same part once more. Never treat text as missing because the display was clipped.

**Step 2.** For every segment, write down each distinct point the source makes (see WHAT TO RECORD).

**Step 3.** Write the whole output file `enrichment/v7/work/t1_s096_20261009/out/luna-max/c1319.jsonl` in one write with your file-writing tool, after you have read every part. Do not write it segment by segment, and do not check partial files.

**Step 4.** Run the check command. If it lists problems, fix only the lines it names (for an anchor problem, copy the words again exactly from the segment; for a word problem, copy the word again from the verse text, or use `["*"]`) and run it again, until it prints `OK`. Do not stop while it still lists problems.

**Step 5.** Stop. Reply with the number of segments and the number of rows.

## WHAT TO RECORD
One row per distinct point. Cover the whole segment, not only the verses in scope.
- The author's own explanation of the verse, and each argument he gives for it.
- Every view he reports, with who holds it. When views differ: each view as its own row, and which one the author prefers or rejects.
- Reports and narrations: who the report goes back to (Companion, Successor, the Prophet), the gist, and any grading the author states. Do not list whole chains.
- Language: word meanings, grammar, rhetoric, readings (qirāʾāt), with the authorities and the poetry cited as evidence (poet, the word the line witnesses).
- Legal, theological, historical and coherence points, and every other verse the source links to this one.

Do not record: the verse text itself, chains with no content, editors' footnotes, page apparatus. Do not copy passages: the claim is a short paraphrase, the anchor a short exact quote.

## OUTPUT: one JSON object per line, one line for EVERY segment, in chunk order
```
{"loc":"EXACT_LOCATOR","rows":[{"verses":["87:6"],"words":["فَلَا تَنسَىٰٓ"],"type":"interpretation","speaker":"مجاهد","stance":"reports","claim":"one-line paraphrase in English","anchor":"exact words copied from the segment","mentions":["2:106"]}]}
{"loc":"EXACT_LOCATOR","rows":[],"none":"short reason, e.g. verse text only"}
```
| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `loc` | the locator exactly as in the segment header |
| `verses` | the verse(s) the point is about, as `S:A` |
| `words` | the word or words of the verse this point is about, copied from the verse text under "Verses in scope" (a phrase is fine); `["*"]` when the point concerns the whole verse rather than a word. For a neighbouring verse not listed there, copy its words as the segment quotes them, or use `["*"]` |
| `type` | exactly one of the types below: what kind of point this is |
| `speaker` | who holds the view, as named in the source and in its own script (e.g. `مجاهد`, `Asad`); `author` when it is the author's own view |
| `stance` | the author's attitude to the point: `holds`, `prefers`, `reports`, `rejects` |
| `claim` | the point in one English line, at most 40 words; name the disagreement or preference when there is one |
| `anchor` | 5 to 25 words copied exactly from the segment (same letters, same order; vowel marks may be left out) that carry the point; when the speaker is not the author, include the words that name him |
| `mentions` | other verses this point quotes or names, as `S:A`; `[]` when none |

Types (pick the one that fits best):
- `meaning`: what a word means: lexicon, root, etymology, Arab usage and poetry cited for the sense
- `grammar`: syntax, iʿrāb, morphology
- `rhetoric`: balāgha: word choice, order, ellipsis, oath form, why this wording
- `readings`: variant readings (qirāʾāt) and their arguments
- `referent`: who or what the words refer to
- `reports`: narrations, occasions of revelation, gradings
- `sciences`: place and order of revelation, verse counting, virtues of the sūra, abrogation
- `interpretation`: the meaning of the verse or phrase: the author's explanation, its point or wisdom
- `theology`: creed and kalām
- `law`: legal rulings
- `links`: coherence with neighbouring verses or the sūra, and connections to other verses
- `inward`: ishārī (Sufi) readings

`none` is only for segments with nothing to record (verse text only, a bare heading, apparatus). If the source text itself is broken, say so in `none`.

## CHECKLIST BEFORE STOPPING
- [ ] every segment has exactly one line
- [ ] every row has verses, words, type, speaker, stance, claim and anchor
- [ ] the check command prints `OK`
