# Commentary v16

2026-09-29. One permitted Opus reading per ayah: what already writes coherent prose, plus assembled findings and a
valve for leftovers. Not the PHASE2 §3 design. That design's supply, bookkeeping rules and integration merge are
rejected by the user's E2 read and `review/adversary/REPORT.md`. v16 is the adversarial audit's next step (§6), with
v5's scope prose tested as a second source of assembled findings.

## Why

- **The base.** E1 (the v9 dictionary arm plus memory permission) writes coherent prose and restores the Quran reach
  (`review/EXPERIMENTS.md`). It lacks the concrete chains; on 1:6 that means the pulley and the supported gait.
- **Assembled findings, not atomized records.** The chains already exist upstream, in two assembled forms:
  - HFT and the channel reviews (the user's rule: use the existing chains);
  - v5's scope prose. v5's 1:6 macro lane assembles the well apparatus (müstakīm's upright, bearing part; the
    well-head timber; water made reachable). v5's S100 micro and global lanes cite 10–17 Quran passages outside the
    surah where the v9 dictionary arm cites 0–2.
- **Leave out v5's consolidation.** It requires every finding to land, which produces a catalogue. It also needs
  the ledgers (the 100:1 consolidator prompt is 759 KB).

## The call

- **Base, identical in every arm:**
  - the E1 prompt byte for byte: `v9/prompts/write_v10.md`, `context.md`, `01_dictionary.md`, and the evidence
    clause with "your own knowledge of Arabic and the Quran";
  - `prompts/additions.md`: three rules from `v9/prompts/writer_rules.md`: most candidates stay out; themed
    threads with a thesis; `## Ek Notlar`.
- **Arm H:**
  - the ayah's HFT records verbatim (`v9/input/v2/…/02_hft.md`);
  - the surah channel review's subchannels anchored in the ayah, verbatim, with their parent headers
    (`latent_activation/network/v3/reviews/sNNN/reader_a_pilot.md`, sliced to `work/…/H/channels.md`).
- **Arm V:**
  - v5 scope prose, `{micro,macro,global}.scope.tr.md`, as written by the scope agents;
  - no discovery JSON, ledgers or consolidated prose;
  - a lane whose gzip ratio is below 0.2 is left out. That lane is template-generated ledger text: 100:1 macro,
    254 KB at 0.058; 100:6 macro, 195 KB at 0.085. Natural prose sits at 0.28–0.38.
  - The evidence clause tells the writer that v5's boundary sentences are that reader's caution, not rules.
- **Model and settings:** Opus 5.5, effort high, `claude -p` in safe mode from a temp directory, no tools.
- **Afterwards:** `review/e0/checks/check.py` writes a record next to the reading. It never edits the prose, and a
  model never reads it.

## First test

| ayah | why | baselines already on disk |
|---|---|---|
| 1:6 | the user's pulley and supported-gait probes | E1 rep1/rep2, E2-B (blind), v9 cold and dictionary arms, v5 middle |
| 100:1 | the v9 bar; the 254 KB templated macro lane | E1 rep1/rep2, v9 cold and dictionary arms, v5 middle |
| 100:6 | same; the oath's answer (kanūd), a different stance | E1 rep1/rep2, v9 cold and dictionary arms, v5 middle |

**Calls and cost:** 2 arms × 3 ayat = 6 calls. `v16.py build` estimates $1.03–1.48 per call, $7.28 in total, at an
assumed 40k output tokens; E1 measured 15–30k. No call estimates at or above $5.

**Comparison:** I read the outputs myself against the baselines. The user's read decides.

**If the pulley or the gait still stays out of the threads:** add one same-session challenge turn ("is this
everything, or did you curate?"). If the chains still don't cross ayat: a surah-first pass.

## Rules

- One call per arm per ayah. No duplicates, no retries, no reruns: an existing `out/…/run.log.json` is never
  overwritten.
- A call starts only when its estimate is below $5, whatever it then costs.
- Every call is logged in `out/ledger.jsonl`.
- No run without the user's approval.

## Files

- `v16.py`: `build` writes `work/<S_A>/<arm>/prompt.md` and `packet.json` and prints sizes and estimates; `run`
  makes the calls (`--arm`, `--ayah`).
- `prompts/additions.md`: the three additions.
- `out/<S_A>/<arm>/`: the reading, `run.log.json` and `check.json`.

## Status

- 2026-09-29: packets built for the first test. No model run yet; waiting for approval.
