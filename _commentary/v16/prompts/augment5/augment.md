You are completing a finished Turkish commentary written by another reader with
what the Quran itself says about it: the Quran explaining the Quran. Below are
the commentary, with its prose paragraphs numbered [¶n]; its ledger; and Quran
passages from an earlier cross-reference list, each with its Arabic, its tier,
and the paragraphs of the commentary that already cite it, if any. A tier is
that list's own judgement, not yours; the list is not authoritative and may be
incomplete.

Read the commentary first. Then judge every listed passage, one by one, against
every paragraph: is it relevant to what that paragraph says? A passage is
relevant to a paragraph when it explains, completes, extends or contrasts
something the paragraph says, or names what the paragraph's ayah leaves
unnamed. A shared word or root alone does not make it relevant; the link must
hold in what the passage says. A passage is never added to a paragraph that
already cites it; it may be added to another paragraph that does not.

Then go through the commentary paragraph by paragraph and ask your own
knowledge of the Quran which ayat, in neither the list nor that paragraph, are
relevant to it in the same sense, and treat them the same way. Quote from them
only words you are certain of, or name them by their source alone.

There is no limit on the number of additions. Leaving out what is not relevant
is part of the work; adding what is not relevant weakens the commentary.

Every relevant passage is added to its paragraph in one of two forms.
- Prose, when the passage changes how the paragraph is understood: give its
  speaker and its situation only as the Quran itself tells them there and in
  the neighbouring ayat; the mechanism of the link (a shared root used in the
  same sense, the same construction, the same scene or speaker, a contrast, a
  completion, an order of events, a name for what the paragraph leaves
  unnamed); and what it adds. As long as the link needs and no longer.
- Reference, when the passage supports or parallels the paragraph without
  changing it: its source with the link in a few words, gathered in the
  paragraph's one reference line.
A passage relevant to several paragraphs gets its prose once, where it changes
the understanding most, and a reference in the others.

The additions are placed by the script after their paragraph, each prose
addition as a paragraph of its own and the reference line last; the
commentary's paragraphs are not touched. So a prose addition opens from its
paragraph's last thought without repeating it, and stops when the link is
made: no formula opener such as "Kur'an bu … başka bir yerde de …", and no
closing sentence that sums up or draws the lesson.

Where the Quran does not name the speaker, or who is meant is disputed (the
speaker of 12:52-53; the two told to go down in 20:123), say only what the ayah
says, without naming anyone. Name another surah by its name ("Tâhâ
suresinde"); "aynı sure" and "bu sure" mean only the surah of the commentary.

Never change or contradict the commentary, and never restate what it already
says. Turkish prose in the commentary's register, warm and direct; explain, do
not dramatize; no first person and no talk about sources or process (no
"sözlük", "harita", "zincir", "liste", no mention of the list or the commentary
itself). Every Arabic quotation goes in the reader tag with its source, the one
ayah that holds the quoted words:
{ar:exact Arabic, tr:readable Turkish transliteration, gloss:Turkish meaning, source:<surah:ayah>}
A passage named without quoting it gets the source alone: {source:<surah:ayah>}.
For a listed passage, copy its Arabic letter for letter from the list. Never
invent a sense, source, speaker, situation or citation. Use no hadith, no
exegetes' views and no report from outside the Quran (no occasion of
revelation, no name the Quran does not give, no date).

Output only this, with no preamble, notes or summary. For each prose addition, a block:
=== ADD ===
paragraph: <n>
ref: <surah:ayah>
text: <the addition, on one line>
For each paragraph that has references, one block:
=== REFS ===
paragraph: <n>
text: Ayrıca: {source:<surah:ayah>} <the link in a few words>; {source:<surah:ayah>} <the link>; …
Then a line containing only
=== VERDICTS ===
then one line for every listed passage, in the list's order, and one for every
passage from your own knowledge that you weighed, marked "own":
- <surah:ayah>: prose ¶n[, ref ¶m …] - <the mechanism in a few words>
- <surah:ayah>: ref ¶n[, ¶m …] - <the link in a few words>
- <surah:ayah>: not relevant - <reason in a few words>
- <surah:ayah> own: prose ¶n | ref ¶n | not relevant - <…>
